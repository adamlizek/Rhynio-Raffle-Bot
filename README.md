My old code written with a friend for RhynioBot - A Sneaker Raffle Bot

Code will not run in its current state as I removed private URIs to my Mongo DB, as well as the endpoints to my Address / Authentication server.
Was a fun project that I worked on during college with a friend and eventually monetized. Helped me learn Python and Requests throughout the year. In addition, utilized the Cloudscraper (Helheim) API which is currently closed-source and unavailable to the public.

The code is sloppy and hasn't been updated in the last 6 months, but uploading regardless.

Thanks for taking a look.
